# Drishyam3D — React UI (ui/)

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold for progressively migrating the Drishyam3D UI.

Quick start:

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the React UI. The `Renderer` select is a placeholder; later we'll wire this canvas to the engine facade and implement a `RendererBackend` for WebGL and WebGPU.
